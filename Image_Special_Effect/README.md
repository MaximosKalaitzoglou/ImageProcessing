# Image special effects
## The purpose is to distort the image to get some "special effects" such as Fisheye lens , Ripples on a pond effect
### To achieve that you transform the images cartesian coordinates(x,y) to polar coordinates (r,θ)
#### Apply the transformation function on your polar coordinates to get the new (r',θ')
#### Then finally transform the new polar coordinates back to cartesian and plot the image
