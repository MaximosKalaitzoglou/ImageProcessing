# Noise reduction using mean noisy images

## first adding sound to the original image and creating 50 new noisy images
### Then getting the mean of the images by adding them together and dividing by K (where K = number of noisy images used)
#### The result should be a new noise reducted image and the difference should be clear
#### You can also plot the graph of the MSE (mean-squared-error) between each iteration (K-MSE)
